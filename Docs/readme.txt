-- I spend 3 hours in this application
-- Improvements for next 2 days
1) Due to time constraint I didn't used TDD approach, 
instead I just build application. 
To Test this I need to create Unit Tests
2) Improve Code where I placed TODO in code
3) Searching won't be efficient as we are searching using Date Slot
I need to manage performance
- Review Alogrithm and DB design 
- To improve performance we can provide User options with availability slots
- Instead of searching through all time slots linearly, 
I could maintain a sorted collection of occupied slots or 
interval of occupied to find available slots.
- Other options to improve and complete functionality

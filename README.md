# TAL-CalendarBooking
# Time Spend : 3 Hours
# Major Improvements for next 2 days
1) Required: Unit Tests 
 Reason Due to time constraint I didn't used TDD approach, instead I just build application.  To Test this I need to create Unit Tests
2) Code and Logic Improvement: where I placed TODO in code
3) Searching won't be efficient as we are searching using Date Slot
4) I need to manage performance
- Review Alogrithm and DB design 
- To improve performance we can provide User options with availability slots
- Instead of searching through all time slots linearly, I could maintain a sorted collection of occupied slots or  inverse of occupied to find available slots.
- Other options to improve and complete functionality
